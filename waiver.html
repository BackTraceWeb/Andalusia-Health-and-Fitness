  <h4 style="margin:1rem 0 .5rem;">WAIVER, RELEASE OF LIABILITY AND COVENANT-NOT-TO-SUE</h4>
  <p>
    I UNDERSTAND AND AGREE that Andalusia Health and Fitness LLC is not responsible to any person for any
    injury or loss of property while that person is practicing, taking class, competing, participating in
    open gym, or otherwise involved in activities at Andalusia Health and Fitness LLC for any reason
    whatsoever, including ordinary negligence on the part of Andalusia Health and Fitness LLC, its owners,
    board of directors, officers, agents, employees, or trainers (“Andalusia Health and Fitness”).
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand the facility is available 24 hours a day and, during non-staff hours, is an unsupervised
    facility. I use this facility at my own risk and will supply my own spotters. I am prohibited from
    allowing any non-member to use the facility or my membership. If I breach this agreement, Andalusia
    Health and Fitness may charge a fee per unauthorized person and may terminate my membership. I
    understand that electronic surveillance and other means may be used to enforce this policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand it is my responsibility to consult my physician before using the facilities and that
    Andalusia Health and Fitness bears no responsibility for my physical health.
  </p>
  <p>
    In consideration of access to the facilities, I agree not to sue and release Andalusia Health and Fitness
    from any and all past, present, or future claims for property damage, personal injury, or wrongful death
    arising out of my participation in weight-lifting, weight-training, exercise routines, or related
    activities, including ordinary negligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recognize that weight-training and related activities involve certain risks, including but not limited
    to serious injury or death. Equipment, safety devices, and spotting may reduce but cannot eliminate these
    risks. I agree to use all safety equipment properly and understand risks may also arise from the actions
    of other participants.
  </p>
  <p>
    This waiver and covenant-not-to-sue is intended to be as broad and inclusive as permitted by Alabama
    law. If any portion is held invalid, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect. Jurisdiction
    and venue for any proceedings arising out of this agreement will be within the State of Alabama, County
    of Covington.
  </p>
  <p>
    I affirm I am of legal age and am freely signing this agreement. I have read and understand that by
    signing I am giving up legal rights and/or remedies which may be available for the ordinary negligence of
    Andalusia Health and Fitness.
  </p>
